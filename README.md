# ****Election_Analysis****
## Overview of Project
- To see how the different candidates fared in relation to their voter turn out and who is the winning candidate based on popular vote. Using the election result dataset that has already been combed through and VSC, results were created for the election outcomes based on votes.
- A Colorado Board of Elections employee has given you the following tasks to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional election.
  1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
  2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
  3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
  4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
  6. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.
  7. Calculate the percentage of votes of each county.
  8. Determine the county with the highest number of votes cast.

### Overview of Election Audit
- The purpose of this analysis was to provide outcomes of the election as seen above, however, the following are the main outcomes:
- The winner of the election was **Diana DeGette** who received **73.8% of the vote and 272,892 number of votes.**
- The county with the largest turnout was **Denver.**
### Election-Audit summary
- The python script can be tailored to be used for any future election audit. By using this process it automates the physical labor of analysis, and provides a detailed report in real time by going through the selected data set. This method provides actionable outcomes for candidates. With modification, the following can be achieved:
1. In depth analysis for other variable fields such as age demographic or race demographic where we can change out the the field to the required data point. See below:

  - Here the script was edited to fit the desired analysis from analyzing the candidate data to county data.

2. By an analyst changing a few variables, the path to the data file can be changed to look at any data. If the data analysis is expanded from one county to two counties then the data can be modified to add on the additional fields and produce the results needed. In addition, the format of the printing output statements can be changed to be revelant to any upcoming election.
